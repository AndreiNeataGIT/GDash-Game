# GDash-Game
This is a game made in IntelliJ IDEA in a week. A fast project made for fun. 


GDash is a 2D platform game inspired by Geometry Dash. The game is about getting through a level filled with obstacles and flying enemies by jumping at the right moment.

Game idea:

- You control a square that automatically moves forward

- Jump over blocks and avoid enemies

- The obstacles on the level are logically placed so that the level can be completed

- When you complete the level, a congratulatory message appears

Features:

- A completed level in the style of Geometry Dash

- Flying enemies and platforms

- Progress bar that shows how far you have come

- Music during the game

- Menu with start and restart options

Controls:

- Space = Jump

- ESC = Back to menu

- P = Pause the game

Objective:

- Get to the end of the level without hitting any obstacles and win the game!
